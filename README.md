Desktop version testing. Don't try to use this, it's all steaming piles of scuffed rat shit.

## Dependencies

- Requires Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 Redistributable. Use the x64 or x86 depending on which version you are trying to compile.
- Requires Microsoft .NET Core (v.3.1) and .NET Framework (v.4.8)

## OSes

- Designed for Microsoft Windows 10 1904
- Could possibly run on macOS 10.14 if ported properly; reliability not guaranteed

## Warnings

- Do NOT delete empty C# functions without checking for references! Only delete functions that are empty AND have zero references!
- It is *very* easy to think that a function has no references. Check the solution in Visual Studio FIRST.
